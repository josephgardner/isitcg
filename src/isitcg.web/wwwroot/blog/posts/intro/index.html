		<h1 class="post-title">Introduction</h1>
		<div class="post-line"></div>

		<p>Welcome to the Is It CG? Blog! If you are asking what this app is all about, hopefully this will clear things up.</p>

<p>Is It CG? evaluates ingredients in consumer hair products in accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curly_Girl_Method">Curly Girl Method</a>, a healthy hair care regimen for natural curls.</p>

<p>Every curly girl at some point finds themselves having to research the ingredients in their vast array of products hoping to find the needle in a haystack that is causing their curly hair to frizz or droop. Suddenly, you are drowning in scientific mumbo jumbo that requires a PHD in chemistry to understand. Trimethylsilylamodimethicone what? üò´ I‚Äôve been there&hellip; but I knew there had to be a better way. Which is why I created the ‚ÄúIs it CG?‚Äù Web app!!</p>

<p>The app works by analyzing each ingredient, and then determining which ones are either CG approved or not approved. This should help you decided whether or not you should that product. Additionally, the app also provides information about the category or ingredient, and how it might affect the chemistry of your hair, both good and bad. Silicons, Proteins, Polyquats, oh my.</p>

<p>No longer do you have to spend hours searching the internet for answers, you can now just enter all the ingredients in the app and it will instantly tell you everything you need to know!</p>
